# jason_mobile_agent_ros

This project demonstrates the use of a BDI agent for navigating through a basic grid environment connected using ROS. There are three versions of the agent, one which navigates using pure AgentSpeak, one which uses an internal action and another which uses an environment based support function.

This project uses Jason to run: https://github.com/jason-lang and http://jason.sourceforge.net/.

The reasoner connects to ROS using SAVI_ROS_BDI: https://github.com/NMAI-lab/savi_ros_bdi

A paper explaining this in more detail was presented at EMAS 2021.
